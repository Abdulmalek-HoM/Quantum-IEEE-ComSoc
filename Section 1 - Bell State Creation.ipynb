    "* **What is Entanglement?** Imagine two quantum particles that become intrinsically linked, no matter how far apart they are. Measuring the property of one instantaneously tells you about the property of the other. Einstein famously called this \"spooky action at a distance.\" It's like having two coins that, when flipped, *always* land on the same side, even if you flip them light-years apart, without any prior agreement.\n",
    "* **Why is Entanglement Important?** This unique quantum correlation is a fundamental resource. It's crucial for:\n",
    "    * **Quantum Communication:** Enabling ultra-secure communication through Quantum Key Distribution (QKD).\n",
    "    * **Quantum Teleportation:** Transferring quantum information from one location to another.\n",
    "    * **Quantum Computation:** Speeding up certain computations by creating complex relationships between qubits."

    "\n",
    "We will now construct the simplest entangled state, often called a **Bell state** (specifically, the $\\Phi^+$ Bell state). It involves just two qubits. Here's the recipe:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Start with Two Qubits at $|0\\rangle$:** Our quantum circuit will begin with two qubits, both initialized in the $|0\\rangle$ state.\n",
    "2.  **Apply a Hadamard Gate (H) to Qubit 0:** This gate puts Qubit 0 into a superposition, meaning it's simultaneously $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ with equal probability. (Remember the coin spinning in the air?).\n",
    "3.  **Apply a Controlled-NOT (CNOT) Gate:** This is the magic gate for entanglement! It uses Qubit 0 (the one in superposition) as the 'control' and Qubit 1 as the 'target'.\n",
    "    * If Qubit 0 is $|0\\rangle$, Qubit 1 remains unchanged.\n",
    "    * If Qubit 0 is $|1\\rangle$, Qubit 1 *flips* (from $|0\\rangle$ to $|1\\rangle$).\n",
    "    * Because Qubit 0 is in superposition, this CNOT gate effectively links the two qubits' fates, creating entanglement.\n",
    "4.  **Measure Both Qubits:** We'll then measure both qubits. If they are truly entangled, we should only see outcomes where both qubits are the same (00 or 11), never different (01 or 10)."
